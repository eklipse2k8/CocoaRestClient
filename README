The goal of this project is to build a lightweight native Cocoa app for testing and debugging HTTP Restful services.
This project was greatly inspired by the Java rest-client (http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/). 

Features:
- Make GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD calls
- Set request body to arbitrary content
- Set request headers
- Set HTTP basic auth
- Auto-format (pretty print) XML and JSON responses
- Display response headers
- Quick save requests in a handy drawer

Credits:
- Contains json-framework/SBJSON library (http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/) embedded in it, source and all
- Mucho guidance from Open Kosmaczewski blog (http://kosmaczewski.net/2008/03/26/playing-with-http-libraries/)

Still a work in progress, but pretty functional!
